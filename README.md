# MeetMate-AI-Agent-for-Smarter-Online-Meetings
MeetMate is an AI agent designed to enhance online meetings by providing real-time transcription, automatic summarization, Q&amp;A support, multilingual translation, and follow-up communication. It uses NLP, speech recognition, and predictive models to streamline productivity and engagement.

AI Agent Development Frameworks

Build an AI Agent that joins or listens to online meetings, performs intelligent tasks such as automatic summarization, Q&A, translation, and follow-up communication.

# Core Features:

1. Real-Time Meeting Summary Generation

      Use speech recognition to transcribe meeting conversations.
      
      Use transformers (summarization) to generate concise meeting summaries.
      
      Store summary along with key highlights and action items.

2. Auto-Mail Summary to Participants

      Automatically email the summary to all attendees (names/emails provided as input).
      
      Include subject-wise bullet points and key decisions.

3. Question and Answering about Meeting Content

      Use transformers (Q&A) to allow participants to ask questions like:
      
          “What did John say about budget?”
          
          “What was the decision on the launch date?”
      
      The system should parse the transcript and return answers contextually.

4. Summary Translation

        Use translation APIs to provide summaries in multiple languages (Tamil, Hindi,           French, etc.).
        
        Provide audio version using gTTS for accessibility.

# Additional Advanced Features (Optional but Bonus-Worthy):

5. Keyword and Topic Clustering

        Use clustering (e.g. K-Means) to group conversation topics or agenda items.
        
        Visualize speaking patterns by participant/topic.

6. Sentiment Analysis of Participants

        Apply predictive models to evaluate participant sentiment                (positive/negative/neutral).
        
        Report mood of the meeting or key emotion shifts.

7. Action Item Extractor

        Identify “to-do” items and assign them to speakers using NLP techniques.
        
        Example: “Ravi will finalize the report by Monday” → Action: Assigned to Ravi.

8. Voice-Controlled Interaction

        Allow users to query or command the agent via voice input during/after the     meeting.

9. Integration with Calendar/Email

        Automatically schedule follow-ups based on actions and decisions.
        
        Send calendar invites for next meetings.
